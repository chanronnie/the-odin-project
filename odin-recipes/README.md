# Odin Recipes

### About this project

**Objective** <br>

Odin Recipes is a project that I built during my web dev learning journey with The Odin Project (and don't forget to mention the cool courses from Brad Traversy!!). [The Odin Recipes assignment](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes) gives few requirements. Here are their initial objectives:

- build a basic recipe website that shows recipes, where each links to their individual webpage using HTML and CSS
- use the **unordered list** for the ingredient lists
- use the **ordered list** for the instructions
- maintain a good file/folder structure for the project
- use Git and Github for version system control as much as possible

Here are the additional steps that I added:

- personalize fonts and text using [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) and [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)
- add **media queries** for a responsive design (friendly user)
- add a small code of **JavaScript** for activating the menu toggle in the mobile version
- use **CSS flex and grid** to arrange my HTML elements
