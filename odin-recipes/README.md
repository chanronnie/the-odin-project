## About this project

Odin Recipes is a project that I built during my web dev learning journey with The Odin Project (and don't forget to mention the cool courses from Brad Traversy!!). [The Odin Recipes assignment](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes) has few requirements.

### Initial Requirements

- Build a basic recipe website that shows recipes, where each links to their individual webpage using HTML and CSS
- Use the **unordered list** for the ingredient lists
- Use the **ordered list** for the instructions
- Maintain a good file/folder structure for the project
- Use Git and Github for version control as much as possible

### Added Features

- Personalize fonts and text using [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) and [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)
- Include extra sections to make the website more readable and presentable, such as navbar, hero section, about section and newsletter subscribe box
- Add **media queries** for a responsive design (user-friendly)
- Add a small code of **JavaScript** for activating the menu toggle in the mobile version
- Use **CSS flex and grid** to arrange my HTML elements
