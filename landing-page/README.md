## About this project

The EchoWave is a project that I built during my web dev learning journey with The Odin Project. The goal of this assignment is to create a landing page from scratch using HTML and CSS.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Design Credit**: It is important to note that the layout and design credits go entirely to [Saif Sarwar](https://www.behance.net/frametix). Instead of replicating the design provided by The Odin Project, I was inspired to bring this talented designer's [template](https://www.behance.net/gallery/198735215/EchoWave-Podcast-Website-Landing-Page-Ui-Design?tracking_source=search_projects_views|podcast+landing+page&l=13), which he created using Photoshop and Figma, to life. The intention of using Saif Sarwar design is purely to put my HTML and CSS skills into practice.

### Initial Requirements

- Create a landing page website from scratch based on the provided [reference](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/81a5d553f4073e593d23a6ab00d50eef8620796d/foundations/html_css/project/imgs/01.png) along with the [design specifications](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/81a5d553f4073e593d23a6ab00d50eef8620796d/foundations/html_css/project/imgs/02.png) using HTML, CSS flexbox and other CSS concepts.
- Maintain a good file/folder structure for the project
- Use Git and Github for version control as much as possible

### Added Features

- Use CSS grid to arrange HTML elements.
- Use **position** properties to place the figcaptions over the images.
- Use CSS **transition** and **transform** properties on the buttons to make them interactive.
- Add **media queries** for responsive design.
- Add a small code of **JavaScript** for activating the menu toggle in the mobile version
