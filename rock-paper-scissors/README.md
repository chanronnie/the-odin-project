## About this project

The goal of this project is to build a rock-paper-scissors game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game features simple setups for winning, and is designed with a **Neo‚ÄîBrutalism** style. The main challenge in this project is writing the game logic in JavaScript and managing setup changes synchronously using DOM manipulations.
